# PyHash
PyHash is a python program to cryptographically hash text and files

# Supported hash functions 
PyHash supports these hash functions: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512

# Browse
The "Browse" button opens a file explorer window. When clicking on "Browse" please be aware that both the file and filepath can be hashed.
This is why there are 2 buttons for hashing. 

# Submit as String and Submit as File
"Submit as String" means that whatever is typed into the input-field is taken literally, even filepaths.
Therefore, when you've choosen a file with "Browse", please press "Submit as File" unless you want the filepath itself to be hashed of course.

# Big Files
Big files may take som time to hash. There is a loading bar.

# Output to txt
The button "Output to txt" outputs the results of the hash in a text file called "HashExport.txt" in the folder where this program is located.

# Compare Hash
"Compare Hash" is a feature to compare any hash with the outputs of your string/file. This is useful for checking the integrity of files for example.

# Copy Hash Results
On the right of the hash output fields there are copy buttons. These copy whatever is in the adjecent text box to your clipboard with 1 press.
