# Welcome to PyHash!
PyHash is a python program to cryptographically hash text and files

Here are some things to be aware of: 

PyHash supports these hash functions: 
MD5 
SHA1
SHA256
SHA384
SHA512

# Browse, Submit as String and Submit as File
When clicking on "Browse" please be aware that both the file and filepath can be hashed.
This is why there are 2 buttons for hashing. "Submit as String" means that whatever is typed into the inputfield is taken literally, even filepaths.
Therefore, when you've choosen a file with "Browse", please press "Submit as File" unless you want the filepath itself to be hashed of course.

# Big Files
Be aware that big files might cause the program to not respond when hashing. Please sit tight and wait instead of closing the window.

# Output to txt
The button "Output to txt" outputs the results of the hash in a neat txt file in the folder this program is located.

# Compare Hash
"Compare Hash" is a feature to compare any hash with the outputs of your string/file. This is usefull for checking the integrity of files for example.

# Copy Hash Results
On the right of the hash output fields there are copy buttons. These copy whatever is in it's respective field to your clipboard with 1 press.
